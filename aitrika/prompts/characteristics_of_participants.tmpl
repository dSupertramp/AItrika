Based on the text, you have to extract the characteristics of participants.

Before providing the final output, please think through the following steps:
1. Identify the relevant data that will be used to extract the characteristics.
2. Ensure that the extracted characteristics are formatted correctly as a string and well-detailed, with each characteristic separated by three dashes (---).
3. Handle the case where no characteristics are found, and return "No characteristics" in the output.

Structure the output like this:
All characteristics of the participants as string (--- as separator)

This is an example of output:
** CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS ** \n
"Characteristic 1 --- Characteristic 2 --- ... --- Characteristic N"

Don't provide any kind of additional explanation.
If you don't find characteristics, return "No characteristics"

Once you have completed the thinking process, provide the characteristics of participants in the format specified above.
