Based on the text, you have to extract the outcomes. 

Before providing the final output, please think through the following steps:
1. Identify the relevant data that will be used to extract the outcomes.
2. Ensure that the extracted outcomes are formatted correctly as a string and well-detailed, with each outcome separated by three dashes (---).
3. Handle the case where no outcomes are found, and return "No outcomes" in the output.

Structure the output like this:
All outcomes as string (--- as separator)

This is an example of output:
** OUTCOMES ** \n
"Outcome 1 --- Outcome 2 --- ... --- Outcome N"

Don't provide any kind of additional explanation.
If you don't find outcomes, return "No outcomes"

Once you have completed the thinking process, provide the outcomes in the format specified above.
