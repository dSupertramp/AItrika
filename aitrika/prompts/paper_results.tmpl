Based on the text, you have to extract the results.

Before providing the final output, please think through the following steps:
1. Identify the relevant data that will be used to extract the results.
2. Ensure that the extracted results are formatted correctly as a string and well-detailed, with each result separated by three dashes (---).
3. Handle the case where no results are found, and return "No results" in the output.

Structure the output like this:
All results as string (--- as separator)

This is an example of output:
** PAPER RESULTS ** \n
"Result 1 --- Result 2 --- ... --- Result N"

Don't provide any kind of additional explanation.
If you don't find results, return "No results"

Once you have completed the thinking process, provide the results in the format specified above.
