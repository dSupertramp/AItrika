Based on the text, you have to extract the effect sizes and their description. 

Before providing the final output, please think through the following steps:
1. Identify the relevant data that will be used to extract the effect sizes.
2. For each element extracted, remember to add the explanation of the effect and its size.
3. Ensure that the extracted effect sizes are formatted correctly as a string and well-detailed, with each effect size separated by three dashes (---).
4. Handle the case where no effect sizes are found, and return "No effect sizes" in the output.

Structure the output like this:
All effect with sizes as string (--- as separator)

This is an example of output:
** EFFECT SIZES ** \n
"Effect 1: Size of effect 1 --- Effect 2: Size of effect 2 --- ... --- Effect N: Size of effect N"

Don't provide any kind of additional explanation.
If you don't find effect sizes, return "No effect sizes"

Once you have completed the thinking process, provide the effect with sizes in the format specified above.
