Based on the text, you have to extract the interventions. 

Before providing the final output, please think through the following steps:
1. Identify the relevant data that will be used to extract the interventions.
2. Ensure that the extracted interventions are formatted correctly as a string and well-detailed, with each intervention separated by three dashes (---).
3. Handle the case where no interventions are found, and return "No interventions" in the output.

Structure the output like this:
All interventions as string (--- as separator)

This is an example of output:
** INTERVENTIONS ** \n
"Intervention 1 --- Intervention 2 --- ... --- Intervention N"

Don't provide any kind of additional explanation.
If you don't find interventions, return "No interventions"

Once you have completed the thinking process, provide the interventions in the format specified above.
