## Install

To install everything, you need `uv`.

First of all, install `uv` with the command:

```
python main.py
```

After that, create a virtual environment with the command:

```
uv venv venv_name
```

Activate the virtual env:

```
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

And install dependencies:

```
uv pip install -r requirements.in
```
